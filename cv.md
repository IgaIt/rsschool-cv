### Information about me:
*My goal is to become a web developer, get a job in an IT company, quit my unloved job and do what I love to do - **programming**. Every day I try to learn programming, learn what's new.
Since I work at my main place of work, not related to programming, I have to wake up at 04:00 in the morning to get all the necessary knowledge. **I feel happy when I write code**, I understand that this is exactly what I am ready to do my whole life!*
